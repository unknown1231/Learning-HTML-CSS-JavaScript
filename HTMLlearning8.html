  Well, the other answers to this question are mostly right- anything which you can program, you can do it in C.

I will take a stab from another angle at this question!

Since initially C++ was converted (using 'CFront') to C, I would consider C++ programs to be equally eligible as answers to this question.

The following is a list of (some of the) programs I have created - in C and
(No name) A Payroll system- traditional batch driven, with reports on Dot Matrix, shifts, loans & advances, salary register
(SimFin) Financial Accounting - DOS based, GUI with mouse & pop-ups, all accounting functions, in use today
(Devyani, Deepika, ...., Dilkash) Desktop Publishing programs: DOS, GUI, mouse, WYSIWYG, Fonts in all Indian languages (Devanagari, Gujarati,...., Kannada, Urdu), complex lay-outing & tabulations, Horizontal and Vertical justification, Graphics, Indian language text editor, Left-to-Right & Right-to-left composing with kerning, in-built scripting, A4 to Broadsheet output on HP Laserjet & PostScript printers with on-screen composing etc
(No name) CNC program: DOS, GUI, 2D engraving on metal plates in English & Indian languages, 3D shape making, I/O to GCode - lego style, Letters around a circle, Outlined letters, postscript shape engraving, Graphics in BMP/PCX
(CART) Computerised Artwork making: Windows, Two paned with graphics in one pane & commands in another - both interchangeable & yet linked, Toolbars for shapes etc
(Devkey) Devanagari Keyboard: Windows based keyboard changer to use Indian language fonts in Windows programs such as PageMaker
(COBOL2C) Cobol to C Converter: Lexx & Yacc based, very fast, Cobol has huge grammar with multiple statement forms
(Sanchay, Darshak) Digital Library Creation & Display: Multi-user composing in Indian languages for single publication, floating keyboard, inbuilt scripting, PDF generation, Dictionaries and Shloka search system, display of compressed text from Sqlite databases in Indian languages with inbuilt searching, digital publications for distribution
(Patholab) Pathological Lab Management: Cancer lab management, Disease & symptom noting, billing & management reports
(Rupika) Beauty Parlour Management: For thousands of service types rendered by hundreds of operators, Scheduling, Inventory, Payroll, Time tracking etc. Primarily for Service Industries
(ResPrint) Variable Printing System: For preparing PDF documents from database records en-masse, with auto sizing photographs and flexible record picking
(DASTest) Depression, Anxity & Stress Testing: Q/A based tests conducted with quick analysis and suggestion of remedies
(BestTime) RFID Card Reader: 8051, 16x2, Embedded systems with windows interface for setting disallowed/allowed users inside the box, setting of time/date & other parameters
(HotelPlus) Hotel Management System: Windows, Booking-Stay-billing, flexible charging methods, analysis
(CpdCon) Cutter, Processor, Drier Controller: Duel microprocessor system for table-top Photo Developer and Printer (called 'Mini-Lab') with graphic LCDs, steppers, DC & AC motors, level sensors, optical sensors, pump controllers, PC interface, multiple temperature sensors, heater controllers etc, including a task switching RTOS
(HighLow) Portfolio Management and Advisor: Web based, real time stock quote scrapping, algorithm based buy-sell advising algorithm
(SimPro) Simple Project Management: Web based, Kanban, charts, notes for each task

(ActiveMRP) Manufacturing Resource Planning System: Purchase, Inventory, Production, Sales, HR for manufacturing organisations, with user changeable items and groups, with in-built document management

Yes, I know that 'you' does not have to literally refer to the person answering the question. Well, these are the real-life examples for which I can certainly vouch as a creator. (I have not included several small programs.) These examples span Commercial, Systems, Embedded programming and use special hardware, thick client as well as web based front-ends.

    C is Turing-complete, so you can by definition create any program that the computer is capable of executing. The better question is, "What real-life programs are C suitable for?"

The answer to that one is, anything low-level. C is the most ubiquitous structured way of programming a microprocessor that still gives you some abstraction. You can go lower-level, but the languages below C will be entirely hardware-dependent (Assembly, microcode and/or machine code), so your ability to transfer use the same code on other computer architectures will be pretty much zero
